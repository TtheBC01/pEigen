# pEigen: Eigen for Python

The project aims to create comprehensive Python bindings for the [Eigen Tux](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) library using 
[Boost.Python](https://github.com/boostorg/python). In particular, pEigen makes it easy to leverage Eigen's efficient
dense and sparse matrix data structures and exposes Eigen's high-performance matrix decomposition algorithms (SVD, QR, etc) 
in an easy-to-use pythonic sdk. 

For information about building this project locally for contributing, see the [developer docs](/DEV.md).

Documentation on objects and methods with examples are coming soon.
